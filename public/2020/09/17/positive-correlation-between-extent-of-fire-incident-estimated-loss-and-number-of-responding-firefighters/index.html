<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>&quot;Fire Incidents Data&quot; is a dataset published by the TFS, Toronto Fire Services, containing 17536 observations of fire incidents defined by the Ontario Fire Marshal. The detailed assessments for each incidents are recorded, such as crew arrival time, estimated loss in dollars, existence and type of fire alarm, number of casualties and more. However, as to the policy of Canadian government, no privacy information or any detail that implies privacy was included.</p>
<p>In this post, the distribution of estimated dollar loss caused by fire incidents, number of firefighters that responded to the incident, and the extent of fire were be examined. The main goal is to assess how the extent of fire includeneces on the other two variables, and explore any correlation between the three of them. However, the findings do not imply any causality so far, since all conlcusions are based on data only and the official method of how TFS respond to fire incidents is unknown.</p>
</div>
<div id="working-on-the-dataset" class="section level1">
<h1>Working on the Dataset</h1>
<div style="white-space: pre-line;">To work with the Fire_Incidents dataset, we need to pull out the data we are interested in and make it tidy for graphing and regression. This could be done by simply selecting the variables we are interested in and removing all the empty observations (the NAs) of those variables. The three discrete variable we are intereted in are named &quot;Estimated_Dollar_Loss&quot;, &quot;Number_of_responding_personnel&quot;, and &quot;Extent_Of_Fire&quot; in the dataset, and this new dataset of three variables act as the observational data. In order to do this, the R package &quot;tidyverse&quot; was used.</div>
<div style="white-space: pre-line;">During the tidying, 6322 incidents were removed for having no value recorded, and those NAs are mostly from &quot;Extent_of_Fire&quot; variable. Another interesting feature of this dataset is that the &quot;Extent_of_Fire&quot; variable included a description of the level of extent in each incident. Extent of fire is a bit different from the others as it is ranked from 1 to 10, 1 being the fire is confined to the object of origin, 10 being the fire spreaded beyond the building of origin. This is useful when interpreting the data, but not so tidy and convenient when graphing it. Therefore, we deleted all the description by taking advantage of the fact that all entry begin with the numeric level of extent of fire.</div>
<div style="white-space: pre-line;">To make the graph more readable, a couple outlier incidents that resulted in more than 6 million dollar estimated loss and required more than 1000 were removed. This should make the graphs to a significantly smaller scale, and therefore more readable. In addition, there exist a special value of 99 in &quot;extent_of_fire&quot;. The 99 stands for extent undetermined, which only appeared 91 among the entire dataset. This special case is also considered as a NA value and therefore filtered out of our data.</div>
</div>
<div id="individual-distribution" class="section level1">
<h1>Individual Distribution</h1>
<p><img src="/post/2020-09-20-Ps1-Yi_Su_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="80%" /></p>
<p>The individual distribution of each variable are displayed as above. For all three variables, the distributions are heavily centered at the left-most end of the graph. In more statistical words, they are all heavily right-skewed.</p>
<p>Looking at fig.1, Notice that the number of 4 personnels appeared a lot, this is because TFS assigns 4 firefighter and 1 fire truck as a unit in most cases. Using that, it is clear that fire incidents with lower extent should appear most often.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2020-09-20-Ps1-Yi_Su_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="80%" /></p>
<p>In fig.2, the majority of estimated loss in dollar are confined under $300,000. This is very intuitive, not all fire incidents results in a significant loss, only if the whole building was burned down or the area spread beyond the district.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2020-09-20-Ps1-Yi_Su_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="80%" /></p>
<p>From distribution of &quot;extent of fire&quot;, we see most incidents have a extent of fire of less than 4, meaning it spreaded beyond room of origin but still at the same floor. Agian, this follows the intuition of most fire incidents are not severe.</p>
</div>
<div id="are-they-correlated" class="section level1">
<h1>Are they Correlated?</h1>
<p>To assess correlation, the use of simple linear regression model and hypothesis testing on correlation coefficients was done for each set of graphs. The regression model shows a direct graphical implication of the relationship and provides the correlation coefficient. The hypothesis testing is just an extra safe to show that correlation is not zero, so we used a null hypothesis of correlation coefficient equal to zero and the alternative being non-zero.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2020-09-20-Ps1-Yi_Su_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="50%" /><img src="/post/2020-09-20-Ps1-Yi_Su_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-2.png" width="50%" /></p>
<p>First, &quot;Extent_of_fire&quot; appears to have a positive relationship with both &quot;Number_of_responding_personnel&quot; and &quot;Estimated_Dollar_Loss&quot;. The blue line in the graph is a simple linear regression line showing a positive correlation between the two variables for all three graphs. Specifically, the SLR model for impact of extent of fire on number of responding personnel is: <span class="math display">\[\hat{y}= 20.1 + 4.45x \]</span>, meaning the expected estimiate loss is 20.1 when extent of fire is 0, and expected number of responding personnel increases for 4.45 when extent of fire raises by level of 1. The SLR model for impact of extent of fire on estimated loss is: <span class="math display">\[\hat{y}= -19138.7 + 24352.9x \]</span>, and the interpretation of parameters are similar to the last model. Notably, the negative intercept is just an expected loss when extent is 0 and does not mean there's a &quot;negative loss&quot; when no fire around.</p>
<p>The R value (correlation coefficient) indicates the strength of relationship. Notice that the correlation coefficient of 0.431 and 0.312 are considered as fairly weak, this is due to the existence of high residual value on the top half of both graphs. Notice the source of this is the large difference in scale of the explanatory and response variables. Extent of fire only takes on 1 to 10, but number of responding personnel reaches almost 500 at maximum, and estimated loss reaches 5 million at maximum. This is also why the correlation coefficient in Fig. 2 is lower than Fig. 1.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are always more elements other than extent of the incident which influences number of responding firefighters and estimated loss. For example, the number of firefighters in a certain responding area is limited in the given time, and maybe the incident happened in an area or building with less valuable item in dollars.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2020-09-20-Ps1-Yi_Su_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="80%" /></p>
<p>Next, Looking at Fig. 6 for the impact of &quot;Number_of_Responding_Personnel&quot; on &quot;Estimated_Dollar_Loss&quot;. The figure above shows that most incidents are clustered at the left-bottom corner, which follows our observation on the individual distribution of there two. The SLR model fitted in Fig.6 is: <span class="math display">\[\hat{y}= 27.43 + (7.26*10^{-5})x \]</span>. Again, the intercept of 27.43 is the expected number of responding personnel when there's no estimated loss, and expected number of responding personnel increases for 7.26e-05 whenever estimated loss increase for 1. The slope of 7.26e-05 is looking small on its own due to the difference in scale of the variables, estimated loss use millions on the axis while number of personnel use hundreds.</p>
<p>A R value of 0. 549 appears that the correlation between number of firefighters involved and estimated dollar loss is stronger than the previous two. However, this does not mean there exist a causality of &quot;more firefighters result in more loss&quot; or the opposite, the more important rule is the extent of the incident. &quot;Extent_of_Fire&quot; acts like a gear between them, linking higher estimated loss with more firefighter involved on average.</p>
</div>
<div id="constraints-of-the-data" class="section level1">
<h1>Constraints of the data</h1>
<p>The Fire Incidents dataset by TFS is a very detailed dataset but constraints still exist.The most obvious but unimportant one is the number of empty entries across the variables due to privacy protection. Beside that, there is no explanation on when is the extent of fire assessed, eventhough it shouldn't make a significant impact on the correlation coefficients, but it becomes a major issue when identifying the possible causality between the variables. In the case of after the incident is stablized, it becomes a more important influencer of loss in dollars. In the case of before, it is more important for number of responding personnels.</p>
</div>
<div id="conclusion" class="section level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>In conclusion, the extent of fire appears to be indeed one of the factor when assessing number of responding personnel and estimating loss in dollars. However, according to the strength of correlation coefficient, extent of fire may not be the main cause for those responding variables to be high. For example, longer fire-extinguish time may give TFS incentive to add the number of responding personnels, and more dangerous location of the incident like gas station may requrie more personnels and equipments to handle. There are more variables in the original dataset that could be potential factors, which could be worth the exploration of future works.</p>
